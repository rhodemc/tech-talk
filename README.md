## Description

I was motivated to create an MVC Tech Blog because I want a place for beginners to ask questions and get answers from more experienced developers. I also want a place for experienced developers to share their knowledge and help beginners. I want to create a community of developers who are willing to help each other and share their knowledge.

## Installation

Once the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the correct file path in your command terminal and enter 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. Once installed, navigate to the db folder, and using your command terminal, login to your mySQL server and run 'SOURCE schema.sql;' to create the database. Return to the root folder and run 'node seeds/seed.js' to populate the database with sample data.

## Usage and Testing

Once necessary dependencies are installed, run 'npm start' in your command terminal to start your local server. Open a browser and navigate to your localhost port. Now you are able to play with the Tech Talk Blog by creating an account, logging in, creating posts, commenting on posts, and logging out.

If you don't want to install but still want to use the app, follow the link below.

Future updates will include a better color palette and will be more functional.
